## Overview

This site is to highlight my skills in web development, both in the site itself and through the links to other projects.
The intention here was always to keep this site looking clean, spacious and simple. It is of one page construction. An earlier incarnation had a link to my CV on a new page â€“ a feature I decided was not necessary. 



## Tech used

- Responsivity is handled by flexbox (CSS)
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
	I have used jquery to allow the user to manipulate the DOM to reveal additional text.
