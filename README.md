## Overview

This site is to highlight my skills in web development, both in the site itself and through the links to other projects.
The intention here was always to keep this site looking clean, spacious and simple. It is of one page construction, with a link to my cv on another page. I felt there was no need to utilise frameworks to handle this.



## Tech used

- Responsivity is handled by flexbox (CSS)
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
	I have used jquery to manipulate the DOM to reveal additional text.
